    # What’s happening?

    On October 29, the youth climate movement around the world want you to join them and demand that bankers, insurers and fund managers **Defund Climate Chaos**.

    On the eve of UN climate talks, led by communities on the frontline of climate impacts, people will lay climate justice memorials outside the UK’s biggest fossil financiers to make it clear at whose doorstep the blame for the climate crisis lies.

    It’s past time to turn off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas companies and start investing in climate justice and a safer future for us all.

    # Why?

    ## **With enough people power, we can force financiers to defund climate chaos. Join us.**

    We’ve all heard that the climate crisis means “**code red for humanity**”. We see the reality raging around us with floods, wildfires and storms every day.

    Yet whilst the planet literally burns, the UK’s biggest financiers keep pouring billions of pounds each year into fuelling the fire. **Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds of London** to name just a few - they are failing us.

    Climate justice demands that we harness our people power to shut off the money pipeline to oil, coal and gas immediately.

    # Climate Reparations Bloc

    Our economic, political and social infrastructures are failing to protect life, and need repairing. At the COP26 Coalition’s 6 November 2021 Global Day of Climate Justice London rally, we’ll be standing with organisers from London Renters Union, No More Exclusions, Revoke and others to co-lead a reparations bloc demanding systems change.
