    # Climate Reparations Bloc

    Our economic, political and social infrastructures are failing to protect life, and need repairing. At the COP26 Coalition’s 6 November 2021 Global Day of Climate Justice London rally, we’ll be standing with organisers from London Renters Union, No More Exclusions, Revoke and others to co-lead a reparations bloc demanding systems change.
