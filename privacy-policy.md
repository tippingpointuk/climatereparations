The Climate Reparations network is hosted by Tipping Point UK, and our privacy policy that continues below applies to how we handle your data. In this case, Climate Reparations UK, Tipping Point UK and Climate Tipping Point UK Ltd refer to the same organisation and organisers.

Tipping Point UK respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. We are transparent about the information we collect and how we will use it because we want you to keep taking action with us to build a tipping point for climate justice.

We take care to ensure that we use your information in accordance with all applicable data protection laws so you can have full confidence and trust when you engage with us online and support our work.

Our full privacy policy is detailed below, but the main points to note are that Tipping Point UK:

* will only ask for information that we need to know to build the movement
* will not keep information for longer than we need it
* will store and use your personal information securely, transparently and honestly
* will always respect your choices about how your personal information is used.
* will never sell your personal information

The law recognises certain types of personal information as sensitive and requiring more protection, including health information, ethnicity and political opinions. This is known as ‘special category’ information.

As Tipping Point works on environmental, social justice, economic and political issues, please note that some of the information which you share about yourself and your interest in these areas may relate to your political opinions and voting intentions.

**We will only collect sensitive personal information in limited cases where necessary and with your explicit consent.**

### **Tailored communications and data analysis**

In order to ensure our communication with you is relevant, timely and will ultimately provide a better experience for you, we may build up a profile of you based on the interactions you have had with us.

This profiling may include details of your past engagement with Tipping Point together with information gathered from sources detailed elsewhere in this Privacy Policy and may be carried out either by Tipping Point or by a trusted partner.

### Legal basis for processing your information

We will always ensure we have legal justification for collecting and using your personal information. The legal basis that we rely on will vary depend upon the circumstances set out above but in all cases, our processing of your personal information will be for one of the following reasons:

1. You have given your **consent** to allow us to use your information in a certain way.
2. It is necessary for us to process your data in order to comply with a legal obligation.
3. It is necessary for us to process your data in the performance of a contract with you
4. It is in our legitimate interests to contact you, for example in order to raise funds and achieve our organisational objectives.

Where we do rely on a legitimate interest to use your personal information, Tipping Point commits to do this in a sensitive way that always respects your rights.

# 4. **How we store and protect your personal information**

We ensure that appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to protect the personal information that we collect and process about you.

The measures we use are designed to provide an appropriate level of security to the risk of processing your information. Specific measures we use include encryption of data in transit and at rest, industry-standard development practices and software update policies to keep software up to date and secure, use of web application firewalls and other security tools, regular security audits and scans, and logging and monitoring of access to Personal Information.

Your personal information is only accessible in Tipping Point UK by staff, volunteers and contractors appropriately trained in and committed to data protection.

We may also use third party suppliers to process and store data on our behalf. Please note that due to the global nature of the internet, the processing of your data may sometimes involve the international transmission of data, and on occasions processing of personal data by third parties (including social media companies) outside the UK.

Some countries outside of the UK have a lower standard of protection for personal information, including lower security requirements and fewer rights for individuals. We can reassure you that we will take all steps to ensure that the data will be held securely and in line with the requirements of UK data protection legislation. However, we want you to be aware that by communicating electronically with us, you understand and agree to our processing of personal data in this way.

We may also merge or partner with other organisations and in so doing transfer your personal information to a successor organisation.

In addition to the disclosures reasonably necessary for the purposes identified elsewhere in this policy, we may disclose your information to regulatory and/or government bodies and/or law enforcement agencies. But only if we need to do so to satisfy a legal obligation.

# 5. Children’s data

The safety of children is of paramount importance to us. If you are aged under 16 and would like to support or get involved with Tipping Point UK, please make sure you have your parent/guardian’s permission before sharing any personal information with us.

All applicable laws are followed with respect to data collection from children. Where we have date of birth information, we will not share data collected from children with any third parties at any time under any circumstances.

# 6. Changes

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and any changes will be reflected on this page, and will hold a record of the changes that we make. When we make significant changes to this policy we will communicate with our supporters to tell them what has changed. Please revisit the policy when you want to confirm how we use your personal information.

This policy was last updated on 31 March 2021
