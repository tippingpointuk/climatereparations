---
This November, Boris Johnson’s government hosts one of the most important international meetings of all time -- the UN climate crisis conference known as **COP26**. This short document hopes to bring community-based groups working on a range of local issues across the UK together, to help push the UK government to show real, justice-centred leadership in this crucial year. It summarises what UK and global climate justice movements are calling for, and what tests we could set to push for climate justice and real UK leadership as we build an intersectional and inclusive movement up to and beyond the COP26 in Glasgow. These **Stop** and **Start demands** reflect our shared understanding that there can be no climate justice without gender, racial, social, economic, health, migrant or environmental justice. We have to transform the whole system and that starts at the community-level.

## **Climate justice means 1.5C to stay alive**

To keep our planet livable for everyone, including the most exposed and marginalised among us, we need to **keep global heating to no more than 1.5C temperature increase**. Our world is already nearly 1.2C hotter. Those least responsible are already paying the highest price and have the least resources to protect themselves from raging climate impacts.

The UK has an outsized historic responsibility to do its [fair share](https://waronwant.org/sites/default/files/20-21_FairShareUK_Infographic_web.pdf) and lead the world in meeting the global climate goal of 1.5C set by the Paris Agreement. Our country is disproportionately responsible for carbon emissions after profiting for over 400 years from slavery, colonialism and the continued extraction and exploitation of communities in the Global South.

We are hearing greenwash pledges to get to ‘Net Zero’ with techno-fixes and more false solutions. **Net zero is NOT zero**. To meet the UK’s fair share of 1.5C to stay alive, we need a rapid and justice-centred transition to get to **real zero carbon emissions by 2030.** That’s just 9 years from now. So how do we get there and how can we force our government to go about it equitably?

The first thing to do when you find yourself in a hole is to **stop** digging. There are red lines the UK government cannot cross if it wants to maintain credibility as a genuine climate leader. And it must **start** providing the care and reparations that communities here and around the world need to protect themselves and repair the damage already done. We hope you will join us in coming together to call for the UK to meet our **stop** and **start** demands.

# **STOP DEMANDS**

## **Climate justice means keeping fossil fuels in the ground, right now.**

### **Real climate leadership from the UK government would mean they STOP:**

* coal, oil, gas and fracking projects
* giving public money to polluting industries
* banks, insurers and other private financiers from supporting and profiting from fossil fuel extraction
* fossil-fuelled militarisation and new infrastructure like roads and airports
* debt collection from global south countries and marginalised communities within the UK
* hostile migration policies
* privatising public spaces and community infrastructure

# **START DEMANDS**

## **Climate justice means securing finance for the care and repair our communities and planet deserve**

### **Real climate leadership from the UK government would mean they START to:**

* make polluters like coal, oil and gas companies pay climate reparations
* invest in good, green jobs, especially for workers transitioning from high carbon industries and projects and those hit hardest by climate impacts, Covid-19, and precarity
* democratise housing, community infrastructure, and land access with strong social protection policies
* pay for the climate harms that the UK drives around the world
* democratise the financial industry to force a just transition
* reverse cuts to Overseas Aid and promote debt relief and cancellation
* democratise corporations continuing to extract and exploit abroad
* create safe ways for people to migrate with dignity
* giving decision making power to communities on the frontline of health, climate, economic, and social injustice
* enable young people to co-create education that serves well-being for thriving and sustainable communities
